function f_values = univariate_interpolant(grid_points,function_on_grid,non_grid_points) 

% UNIVARIATE_INTERPOLANT interpolates a univariate function on grid points, i.e. evaluates the   
% Lagrange polynomial approximation on a generic point of the parameter space.
%   
% F_VALUES = UNIVARIATE_INTERPOLANT(GRID_POINTS,FUNCTION_ON_GRID,NON_GRID_POINTS) evaluates the
%       lagrangian interpolant of a vector function F: R -> R^V based on the points contained in the vector GRID_POINTS.
%       GRID POINTS is a row vector with the nodes of interpolation
%       FUNCTION_ON_GRID is a matrix containing the evaluation of F on the points GRID_POINTS. 
%       Its dimensions are V x length(GRID_POINTS)
%       NON_GRID_POINTS is a row vector of points where one wants to evaluate the polynomial approximation.
%       F_VALUES is a matrix containing the evaluation of the function F in each of the NON_GRID_POINTS. 
%       Its dimensions are V X length(NON_GRID_POINTS)
