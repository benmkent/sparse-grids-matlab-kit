function coeff = combination_technique(I)

% COMBINATION TECHNIQUE computes the coefficients of the combination technique expression of a sparse grid
%
% COEFF = COMBINATION_TECHNIQUE(I) takes as input a multiidx set I, each associated to a Delta operator
%       in the sparse grids construction. It then computes the coefficients of the combination technique
%       expression of the same sparse grids, i.e.,  the same sparse grids computed as linear combination
%       of tensor grids. 
%
%       I must be a multiidx set matrix (one row per index), admissible and lexicographically sorted.
%       These two properties will **not** be checked by the function.
%
%       COEFF is a vector containing the combination technique coefficients
