function [Sob_i,Tot_Sob_i,Mean,Var] = compute_sobol_indices_from_sparse_grid(S,Sr,nodal_values,domain,flags)


% COMPUTE_SOBOL_INDICES_FROM_SPARSE_GRID computes the Sobol indices of a scalar-valued function f:R^N -> R  in two steps: 
% 1) converts the sparse grid approximation of that function into its equivalent Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE);
%    this operation is performed by calling CONVERT_TO_MODAL
% 2) performs algebraic manipulations of the PCE coefficients.
%
% [SOB_I,TOT_SOB_I,MEAN,VAR] = COMPUTE_SOBOL_INDICES_FROM_SPARSE_GRID(S,SR,NODAL_VALUES,DOMAIN,FLAGS) takes the
%       same inputs of CONVERT_TO_MODAL (see step 1 above) and returns the Sobol indices of the function F. 
%
%       In details:
%       1) SOB_I is the principal Sobol index of the i-th variable, y_i; i.e., the fraction of variability of F that
%          can be ascribed to y_i only
%       2) TOT_SOB_I is the total Sobol index of y_i; i.e., the fraction of variability of F that can be ascribed
%          to y_i either alone or combined with any other variable.
%
%       As by-products, the function returns also:
%       3) MEAN, the expected value of F, computed as the coefficient of the constant polynomial in the PCE
%       4) VAR, the variance of F, computed as sum of squares of PCE coefficients minus MEAN^2

% first, call convert_to_modal
[gpce_coeffs,idx_set] = convert_to_modal(S,Sr,nodal_values,domain,flags);

N = size(Sr.knots,1);
Nb_coeff = length(gpce_coeffs);

% I create two matrices that I use to mark the coefficients that I need to sum to get the Sobol indices.
% Both have one column for each variable and one row for each gPCE coefficient.
%
% In the first one, I mark with 1 the entry (i,j) if the i-th coefficient must be used to compute
% the principal Sobol index of the j-th variable. 
%
% In the second one, I do the same but for the Total Sobol index
Fact_STi = zeros(Nb_coeff,N);
Fact_Si = zeros(Nb_coeff,N);

% loop on coefficients, for each one decide if I should mark it or not. Note that the first PCE coeff 
% gives the mean of the function and does not enter the Sobol index computation, so I can start from 
% the 2nd coefficient

for r=2:Nb_coeff

    % check the multi-idx of this coefficient and find which entries are non-zero
    Ind=find(idx_set(r,:)>0);     
    
    % the current coefficients is then to be used to compute the total sobol index
    % of all those variables
    Fact_STi(r,Ind) = 1;    
    
    % moreover, if there is only one non-zero entry in the multi-idx, than this coefficient
    % must be marked for use in the computation of the principal sobol index
    if length(Ind)==1
        Fact_Si(r,Ind) = 1;  
    end
