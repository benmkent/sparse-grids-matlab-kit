function [S,I,coeff] = smolyak_grid_add_multiidx(new_idx,S_in,I_in,coeff_in,knots,lev2knots)

% SMOLYAK_GRID_ADD_MULTIIDX produces a grid obtained by adding a single multi-idx to a previously existing grid.
%
% [S,I,COEFF] = SMOLYAK_GRID_ADD_MULTIIDX(NEW_IDX,S_IN,I_IN,COEFF_IN,KNOTS,LEV2KNOTS) takes as inputs:
%       --> an index NEW_IDX. It must be admissible wrt to the index set I_IN described below, and this condition **won't** be checked
%           by the function
%       --> a sparse grid S_IN to which NEW_IDX should be added
%       --> the index set I_IN that was used to create S_IN, either implicitly (by defining the rule in SMOLYAK_GRID)
%           or explicitely (by using SMOLYAK_GRID_MULTIIDX). Note that this cannot be produced as the union of the indices S_IN.idx,
%           because S_IN contains only tensors whose coefficient in the combination technique is non-zero, while here we need them all.
%       --> COEFF_IN is the vector of coefficients of the combination technique obtained on I_IN. Note that this
%           vector of coefficients *MUST* include also zeros if a row of I_IN has coeff zero in the combination technique.
%           Therefore, COEFF_IN cannot be taken as [S_in.coeff]. Instead, use COEFF_IN = COMBINATION_TECHNIQUE(I_IN)           
%       --> KNOTS, LEV2KNOTS are the usual arguments to specify knots and lev2knots (see e.g. SMOLYAK_GRID)
%
%       The function outputs:
%
%       --> S, the new sparse grid
%       --> I, the new multiidx set, i.e. I = sortrows([I_IN; NEW_IDX])
%       --> COEFF, the updated vector of coefficients of the combination technique
